## News

At present, our core contributors are preparing the **65B** version and we expect to empower WizardLM with the ability to perform instruction evolution itself, aiming to evolve your specific data at a low cost.

- ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ [7/25/2023] We released **WizardLM V1.2** models. The **WizardLM-13B-V1.2** is here ([Demo_13B-V1.2](https://215c4ac7fdbf38ec.gradio.app), [Demo_13B-V1.2_bak-1](https://447b774e88af2d2d.gradio.app/), [Full Model Weight](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2)). **WizardLM-7B-V1.2**,  and **WizardLM-70B-V1.0** are coming soon.

Please checkout the [Delta Weights](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244).

- &#x1F4E3; We are looking for highly motivated students to join us as interns to create more intelligent AI together. Please contact caxu@microsoft.com

<!-- Although on our **complexity-balanced test set**, **WizardLM-7B has more cases that are preferred by human labelers than ChatGPT** in the high-complexity instructions (difficulty level >= 8), it still lags behind ChatGPT on the entire test set, and we also consider WizardLM to still be in a **baby state**. This repository will **continue to improve WizardLM**, train on larger scales, add more training data, and innovate more advanced large-model training methods. -->


<b>Note for 30B and 13B model usage:</b>

To obtain results **identical to our demo**, please strictly follow the prompts and invocation methods provided in the **"src/infer_wizardlm13b.py"** to use our 13B model for inference. Unlike the 7B model, the 13B model adopts the prompt format from <b>Vicuna</b> and supports **multi-turn** conversation.

<b>For WizardLM-13B-V1.0, WizardLM-30B-V1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: hello, who are you? ASSISTANT: 
```

<b>For WizardLM-7B-V1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
"{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```

<b>For WizardCoder-15B-V1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\n{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```

### GPT-4 automatic evaluation

We adopt the automatic evaluation framework based on GPT-4 proposed by FastChat to assess the performance of chatbot models. As shown in the following figure, WizardLM-30B achieved better results than Guanaco-65B.

### WizardLM-30B performance on different skills.

The following figure compares WizardLM-30B and ChatGPTâ€™s skill on Evol-Instruct testset. The result indicates that WizardLM-30B achieves 97.8% of ChatGPTâ€™s performance on average, with almost 100% (or more than) capacity on 18 skills, and more than 90% capacity on 24 skills.

## Overview of Evol-Instruct

[Evol-Instruct](https://github.com/nlpxucan/evol-instruct) is a novel method using LLMs instead of humans to automatically mass-produce open-domain instructions of various difficulty levels and skills range, to improve the performance of LLMs.
