{"idx": 17, "Instruction": "Write a Python code to simulate quantum computing: we have a 3-qubit circuit, starting with the all-zero state. Then a Hadamard gate is operated on every qubit. Then a control-not gate is operated on the first and third qubit, where the first qubit is the target qubit. You should print the final state."}
