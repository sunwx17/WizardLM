We then iterate over all the cells of the grid and compute the minimum cost of reaching each cell using the values of the previous cells. We use the minimum of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to compute the cost of reaching the current cell. We also update the answer list `ans` by appending the value of the current cell to the list. Finally, we backtrack from the last cell to the first cell of the answer list and return the list in reverse order.", "result": "failed: ", "passed": false}
